# Custom BitcoinSV Transaction Tool Bounty

## Introduction
This repository contains a bounty proposal for the development of a Custom BitcoinSV Transaction Tool for students in the NITDA blockchain innovation program. The goal of this tool is to provide an easy-to-use interface for creating, signing, and broadcasting BitcoinSV transactions on the regtest network. The front-end HTML code has been provided, and the backend will be powered by a BitcoinSV regtest node.
