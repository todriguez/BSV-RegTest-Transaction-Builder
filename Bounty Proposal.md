# Custom BitcoinSV Transaction Tool Bounty

## Introduction
This repository contains a bounty proposal for the development of a Custom BitcoinSV Transaction Tool for students in the NITDA blockchain innovation program. The goal of this tool is to provide an easy-to-use interface for creating, signing, and broadcasting BitcoinSV transactions on the regtest network. The front-end HTML code has been provided, and the backend will be powered by a BitcoinSV regtest node.

## Bounty Details

### Eligibility
The applicant must be a current student of the 2023 NITDA Blockchain Innovation Program.

- Mine blocks
- Display Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs)
- Create the unsigned raw transaction data 
- Create the transaction preimage based off the specified SIGHASH flag.
